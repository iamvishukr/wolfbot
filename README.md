WolfBot is a simple, frontend-only chatbot interface built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. There‚Äôs no backend, no real AI ‚Äî just a fun experiment with design, layout, and component structure.

This project is a small, light-hearted tribute to a friend of mine, whom I affectionately call **Wolfie**. In this UI, Wolfie is the chatbot ‚Äî friendly, quirky, and always ready to reply (even if the replies are just placeholders for now). It started as a casual idea and turned into a great way to explore smooth interactions and styling with Tailwind.

## Tech Stack

The project is built with:

* React for component-based UI
* Vite for fast builds and instant hot reloading
* Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
* ESLint for basic code linting

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wolfbot.git
   cd wolfbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to see it in action.

## Project Structure

* `src/components` contains all the reusable UI elements
* `src/assets` holds any images or icons used in the project
* `App.jsx` defines the main application layout
* `main.jsx` is the entry point that renders the app

## Notes

This is a purely frontend project ‚Äî there's no backend or database. It doesn‚Äôt connect to any real AI engine, though it could easily be extended to use one in the future. Right now, it‚Äôs more of a concept demo: a playful chatbot UI with Wolfie as the central character.


Let me know if you'd like to include:

* A custom message from "Wolfie"
* Deployment link (if hosted anywhere)
* A short story or inspiration behind the idea
